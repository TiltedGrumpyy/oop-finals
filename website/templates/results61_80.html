            <br>Experiencing discrimination often would indicate a really bad environment that you suffer from. It is truly daunting that discrimination is present and as a student experiencing discrimination often speaks a lot about how much our country should improve more in terms of protecting our youth from discrimination and all its effect on the students. Please take time to heal and support other victims of discrimination as well by sharing knowledge about discrimination and to support proper groups and laws that will help lessen discrimination in our country.
