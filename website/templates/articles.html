                <h1>“Just Let Us Be”: Discrimination Against LGBT Students in the Philippines</h1>
                <p>Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.</p>

                <h1>Concerns on attire discrimination arise after DepEd makes uniforms optional</h1>
                <p>Vice President and Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Sara Duterte’s pronouncements on July 18 making school uniforms optional for school year 2022 to 2023 earned mixed reactions from social media users.
                    Duterte said that making uniforms non-mandatory is meant to ease the financial burden on students’ families impacted by “increasing prices and economic losses” due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                    <p>Young Filipino Muslims feel that they are being discriminated against because of their religion.
                    Most of the respondents of a risk perception survey conducted by International Alert among Muslim youth early this year said they feel that they are being discriminated against because of their religion.
                        The survey was done in a village in the Philippine capital and in the northern city of Baguio during the first quarter of the year.</p>

                    <p>At first glance, the deeply Catholic Philippines can seem surprisingly LGBT-friendly. In a nation of 110 million people, more than 110,000 showed up last week to Quezon City’s Pride festival, making it by far the largest LGBT congregation in Southeast Asia. The country also ranks highest in the region for LGBT social acceptance.</p>

                    In the Philippines, bullying is also a problem experienced in many schools. In the school year 2015-2016 alone, local media reported that there were “11,448 incidents of bullying,” as documented by the Department of Education.</p>

The policy is an important step toward providing equal rights for all students—but history shows it is unlikely to make a real difference for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youth unless the DepEd transforms its promise into meaningful protection.</p>
